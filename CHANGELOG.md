# Changelog

Every release names its numbers — package, protocol range, config schema range and,
from 0.4, patch format range —
then what changed, breaking changes first. The rules for all three are in
[VERSIONING.md](./VERSIONING.md); an entry is written before its tag (P6).

## Unreleased

### Breaking

- **The command `hatch grammars` is gone.** It shipped in 0.2, fetched the grammars into
  a user cache, and since 0.4 did nothing but warn — one minor release with the old
  spelling still working, as F2 asks. `hatch grammars` now exits 1 as an unknown command,
  and `hatch` no longer lists it. Breaking for the package (P3), so the release carrying
  it is at least a minor one (P2).
  → drop `hatch grammars` from scripts and CI; nothing replaces it, because nothing is
  downloaded — the grammars ship inside hatch. In the repository the grammars are put in
  place by `npm run grammars` (`scripts/fetch-grammars.ts`), which `npm test` and
  `npm pack` already run.
- **The flag `--download-grammars` is gone**, from `apply`, `generate` and — since its
  options are picked out of `apply`'s (F2) — from `hatch-apply`. It shipped in 0.3, and
  since 0.4 was accepted, did nothing and warned: the one minor release F2 asks for. It is
  now an unknown argument (exit 1), and out of `--help`. Breaking for the package (P3).
  The protocol param `allowDownload` is **unchanged**: still accepted, still ignored —
  dropping it would raise `protocolMin` (R5) and break every released client, which no
  release has a reason to do yet.
  → remove the flag from scripts and CI; there is nothing to allow, because nothing is
  downloaded. A client over the service may keep sending `allowDownload`.
- **`LanguageAdapter.init()` takes no argument, and `InitOptions` is gone** from the
  package's exports, together with `GenerateRequest.init`. Nothing had read that object
  since 0.4: its one field, `log`, was there to report a grammar being downloaded, and
  grammars ship inside hatch. An export of `src/index.ts` changed, so breaking (P3).
  → a caller that wrote `adapter.init({})` writes `adapter.init()`, and one that passed
  `init` to `generatePatch` drops it; neither did anything.

### Added

- **`npm run bench`** — the speed and performance cases, as a suite of their own
  (`bench/`): `parse`, `apply`, `generate`, `probes`, `depth`, on a synthetic C++ stand
  that is the same on every machine. `--case`, `--reps`, `--budget`, `--big`; a per-cell
  budget so one heavy case cannot eat the run. The suite holds the stand and the cases;
  the numbers it produces are recorded outside the package, with the stand each was taken
  on. It is **not** part of `npm run check`: the heavy cases take minutes.
  `npm run typecheck` covers it.

### Changed

- Internal, no behavior: the rule "the root a relative path is measured from — the
  repository around the file, else its own directory" is one function, `repoRootAround`
  in `infra/fs.ts`, which both the writer of a patch (`out-path.ts`) and its reader
  (`pair.ts`) call; "read the file if it can be read" is `readIfReadable` there, beside
  `readInputFile`, which keeps the opposite contract (absence is an error naming the
  flag); and the pair "render the error, take its exit code" is `reportFatal` in
  `infra/log.ts`, which the entry points call instead of each spelling it out. Seven
  values that no other module used are no longer exported. `infra/fs.ts` gained `kindOf`,
  which answers "a file, a directory, something else, or nothing there" in one `stat`, so
  `out-path.ts` — the last module outside `fs.ts` to reach for `statSync` — no longer
  does; `statSync` is now called in `fs.ts` alone.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-10-06

**Protocol 4–4 · config schema 2–2 · patch format 1–1**

The first release of the 0.4 line: the tag `v0.4.0` was pushed, its check failed on
Windows and Linux (see Fixed), and nothing was published under it. The number is not
reused (P7), so everything 0.4.0 would have brought is here.

### Breaking

- **A patch is a `.hatch` file.** `generate` writes `<name of --in>.hatch`; `apply
  --match` refuses any other name ("a patch is a .hatch file"), and `pair` takes a
  `.md` for code. The hunks inside are the same to the character. hatch 0.1–0.3 wrote
  `.md`; F1 is rewritten for this in VERSIONING.md (decided 2026-10-02: no one used
  hatch yet, and a patch that looks like Markdown is reformatted by Markdown tools).
  → rename your patches: `git mv x.md x.hatch`; scripts and CI that name `*.md`
  patches name `*.hatch`.
- `generate --out` (and `generate.out`, the service's `out`) that names a file with
  another extension than `.hatch` is refused with `ConfigError` (exit 5) before any
  file is read; before it wrote the file under that name. A directory is taken as
  before.
  → name the file `*.hatch`, or give a directory.
- **The header replaces the marker line.** A `.hatch` opens with `Name: value` lines up
  to a blank line: `Hatch: 1` (the format number, VERSIONING.md H1–H3), `Target` (the
  file it patches, from the repository root), `Generated-From` (the git blob of the
  base, when it came out of git), `Generated-By`, `Grammar`. `<!-- hatch: target=… -->`
  is no longer written or read: before the first `# match` it is prose, as it always
  was. A file with no header applies as format 1; a format newer than this hatch reads
  is refused with "update hatch".
  → regenerate the patch, or replace the line with `Hatch: 1` and `Target: <path>`
  followed by a blank line.
- **`--no-marker`, `generate.marker` and the protocol param `marker` are removed** —
  `Target` is always written when the patch has a place. None shipped in a release. In
  `pair`, `how: "marker"` is now `"target"` and the reason `unsafe-marker` is
  `unsafe-target` (protocol 4, unreleased).
  → drop `--no-marker` from scripts and `generate.marker` from `hatch.config.json`.
- **A project and its upstream; `generate.mirror` and `--mirror` are removed.** A
  config may name `"upstream"`: the root of the code the project patches, measured from
  the config file (`".."` for a project inside its upstream, `"upstream"` for an
  upstream inside the project, `"."` for one repository). The patch of a file is then
  `<config dir>/<generate.out>/<path from the upstream>.hatch`, and its `Target` is that
  path. `--mirror` goes without the release where it would still work and warn (F2) —
  decided by the author 2026-10-02.
  → replace `"mirror": true` with `"upstream": "."` at the top level of the config
  (`generate.out` stays); drop `--mirror` from scripts — the config does it.
- **Config schema 1 is read no longer** (`CONFIG_MIN` 2, C3): such a file is refused with
  "move the file to v2".
  → set `"version": 2` and replace `generate.mirror` as above; nothing else changes.
- **The config of a file is looked for in more places.** Up from the file to its
  repository root as before; then a config whose `upstream` holds the file — in the
  subdirectories of every repository root on the way up, and above the repository;
  then `$HATCH_CONFIG`, then the current directory. Two such configs are an error that
  names both. A patch finds its config up from itself.
  → nothing for a project of one repository; for a project over an upstream, add
  `"upstream"` to its config.
- **`apply --verify` needs a clean base.** It takes the base out of git — the git flags,
  else `generate.base` of the config; with neither, a person at a terminal is asked
  whether the files on disk are that base, and without one it is refused (exit 1).
  `apply` that writes is unchanged.
  → name the base (`--head` / `--branch` / `--commit`, or `generate.base`), or add
  `--base-from-disk`.
- **`generate` asks before writing over another file's patch** at a place it computed
  (two files met at one name): `--yes` goes ahead, without a terminal it is refused
  with `ConfigError` (exit 5). The same file's patch, and a `--out x.hatch` named
  outright, are written over as before.
  → pass `--yes` where that is meant.
- Over the service (protocol 4): `pair` answers `how: "upstream"` instead of `"mirror"`,
  the reason `outside-upstream` instead of `outside-repository`, and the new reason
  `two-patches` with `patchPaths`; the param `mirror` is gone.
  → a client switches on the new names.
- **A grammar in `HATCH_GRAMMAR_DIR` must be the pinned one.** A file whose sha256
  differs from the pin fails the run (`GrammarError`, exit 6); before it was used with a
  warning.
  → put the pinned grammar there (`npm run grammars` fetches it), or unset the variable.
- **`HATCH_GRAMMAR_CACHE` and `HATCH_GRAMMARS_DOWNLOAD` do nothing**: there is no
  download and no cache any more (see Added).
  → drop them from CI; the old cache directory can be deleted.
- **The protocol field `md` is now `patch`**: the text `generate` answers, and the one
  `resolve`, `apply` and `pair` take. Inside protocol 4, which already raises
  `protocolMin` to 4 (R3); `mdSpan` and `mdLine` keep their names.
  → a client reads `result.patch` and sends `params.patch`; the VS Code extension 0.0.1
  is updated with this release.
- `hatch generate` with nothing to change — the new version is the old one, line for
  line as the language normalizes it, blank lines not counted; with `--exact`, byte for
  byte — exits **7** with `NoChanges: the new version is the base …` and writes no
  patch. Before: exit 0, `generated 0 hunk(s)`, and a patch of one empty line that no
  hatch could apply. A change of only spacing or blank lines now counts as none.
  → a script that runs `generate` on files that may be unchanged treats exit 7 as
  "nothing to do", not as a failure, and stops expecting a patch for such a file.
- Over the service, the same request fails with the new error kind `NoChanges`
  (`exitCode` 7, `detail.baseSpec`) instead of `ParseError` "no match/patch pairs"
  (protocol 4). By R5 a change a client could notice, so **`protocolMin` rises to 4**:
  a client of protocol 2 or 3 is refused with "update the client".
  → the VS Code extension 0.0.1 speaks 4–4 and ships together with this release; no
  other client of protocols 2–3 was released.
- VERSIONING.md: S2 (announce a raise of `protocolMin`/`CONFIG_MIN` one release ahead)
  is removed, with its reason; S4 carries its own notice rule.
- `hatch generate` that cannot anchor a change exits **8** with `SynthesisError: could
  not anchor the change at line N of the new version — …`. Before: exit 3 or 4, as a
  `MatchError` or an `AmbiguityError` — the codes of a patch that does not apply, with
  positions in a text the reader never saw. A person at a terminal is still handed the
  editor, as before.
  → a script that reads exit 3/4 from `generate` as "could not anchor" reads 8; 3 and 4
  now come from `apply` only.
- Over the service, the same `generate` fails with the new error kind `SynthesisError`
  (`exitCode` 8, `detail.reason` — `no-match`, `ambiguous`, `unreproduced` — and
  `detail.newLine`) instead of `MatchError`/`AmbiguityError` (protocol 4, inside the
  raise of `protocolMin` above).
  → a client that told "could not anchor" by `MatchError`/`AmbiguityError` from
  `generate` switches on `SynthesisError`; the VS Code extension shows the message and
  needs no change.
- The service answers each request when it is done, **not in the order they came**:
  `generate` hands the loop back after every change, and a `pair`, a `config` or a
  `cancel` sent meanwhile is answered before it (protocol 4, inside the raise of
  `protocolMin` above). PROTOCOL.md said "one at a time, in order".
  → a client pairs replies with requests by `id`; the VS Code extension already does.
- The API of the package: `generatePatch` with nothing to change throws `NoChanges`,
  and `synthesize`/`generatePatch` that cannot anchor a change throw `SynthesisError`
  — where they returned an empty patch, and threw `MatchError`, `AmbiguityError` or a
  plain `Error`. Both classes are exported now.
  → code that calls them catches `NoChanges` and `SynthesisError` from `hatch`.

### Added

- **Notes on hunks.** A `# note` … `# end` block right before a `# match` is the
  author's comment on that hunk: prose in any column, no gutter, never read by the
  matcher. Over the service the hunk in `resolve`/`apply` carries `note` and `noteSpan`
  (protocol 4). Text between hunks outside a note is still a parse error, now with a
  message that names the note block. Every patch applies as before (F1): before the first
  `# match` only a closed note followed by blank lines is read as one, any other prose
  there is prose as always (apply golden `c/apply/10`). A patch with notes needs this
  release: hatch 0.3.0 refuses it with "text between hunks is not supported".
  `generate -a` keeps a note written in its editor, before the hunk it is about;
  `generate` itself writes none, and generating a patch again drops the notes in it.
- `--eol repository|worktree` for `generate` and `apply`, `generate.base.eol` (config
  schema 2), `baseGit.eol` (protocol 4): a version read out of git with the line
  endings of the file on disk (`worktree`), for repositories with `core.autocrlf`,
  where git stores LF and the checkout has CRLF. The conversion is the rule a patch
  already lands by — the endings of the file — read off its first line. The default,
  `repository`, is the old behavior.
- **`hatch-apply`** — a new release file for project builds: one executable with Node,
  the tree-sitter runtime and the grammars inside, for linux-x64, linux-arm64,
  darwin-arm64 and win-x64, with `SHA256SUMS`. `hatch-apply apply|verify --match
  <patch>`: the file by `Target`, the base out of git (or `--base-from-disk`, which warns
  that the files on disk are taken as it), no questions — what `hatch` would ask about
  (a tag named as a branch, a commit off the branch named) is refused; exit 5 when no
  clean base is named. In place — `apply` without `--out` — a file that already holds
  the result is not written again (no new mtime for the build to recompile over), and a
  file with changes of its own is written over and said so: the code a build patches is
  not the project's to keep, and a patch that changed is laid on the clean base again.
  `--version` prints the Node inside and every grammar pin. Its options are picked out of
  `hatch apply`'s, so each has the same meaning (VERSIONING.md F2, a test holds it), and
  every apply golden runs through each binary in CI and in the release.
- The package's entries are in `dist/bin/`: `hatch` is `dist/bin/hatch.js`, the service
  `dist/bin/service.js`; `node dist/service/index.js` still starts the service, as the
  VS Code extension does, and `import { serve } from 'hatch/service'` is unchanged.
  Modules of the CLI no longer run when started directly (`node dist/cli/apply.js`).
- **The grammars ship inside hatch** (`grammars/` of the package, about 17 MB, 1.7 MB
  packed): `apply` and `generate` work right after `npm i`, offline, and nothing is ever
  downloaded. `hatch grammars` and `--download-grammars` still work in this release, do
  nothing and say so — they are removed in 0.5 (F2). Over the service `allowDownload`
  is accepted and ignored. In the repository `npm run grammars`
  (`scripts/fetch-grammars.ts`) fetches the pinned grammars; `npm test` and `npm pack`
  run it.
- `apply` without `--in`: the file is the one the patch names in `Target` — from the
  upstream of the project, else from the repository around the patch. `apply --config`
  and `--no-config`.
- `hatch init --upstream <path> [--out <dir>]` writes `"upstream"` and `generate.out`
  (default `patches`) into the config of the project, and refuses an upstream that is
  not there.
- Protocol 4:
  - `configPath` (absolute) in the params of `generate`, `resolve`, `apply` and in the
    `overrides` of `config`, `pair`: the config to use, no search — the layout of a
    project beside its upstream.
  - `generate` answers `outExists` and `outTarget` — whether a file is at `outPath` and
    the `Target` it names — so a client asks before writing over another file's patch.
  - `config` answers `upstreamRoot`, and watches a config found by its claim.
  - `resolve` and `apply` take the patch's own path: its text from disk unless sent, the
    code by `Target`, the base from the patch's config. Both answer `code` (the file the
    patch was laid on), `header` (the patch's header as read) and `warningsAt` — the
    same marks `generate` gives, for a patch edited by hand too (X1).
  - `config` answers `projectRoot` and `target` (the pair's `Target`); `config` and
    `pair` take `configPath` beside `overrides`.
  - `GitError` carries `detail.reason`: `no-such-file`, `not-a-file`, `no-such-branch`,
    `not-a-branch`, `no-such-commit`, `not-on-branch`, `no-commits`, `no-repository`,
    `outside-repository`, `bad-coordinate`, `no-git` (X2).
  - Error messages over the service name no CLI flag: `nope: no such branch …`; the CLI
    still says `--branch nope: no such branch …` (X3).
  - Every reply carries `elapsedMs` (X4).
  - `config { path, overrides? }` answers the settings `generate` would apply with those
    params — the same code reads both — the config file's schema version, the
    repository root, the base (`text`, or `git` with `spec`, the full `sha` and `eol`)
    and `watch`: the paths whose change may change the answer (config files up the
    tree, `HEAD`, the branch's ref, `packed-refs`, worktrees included).
  - `pair { path, patch?, overrides? }`: a file of code and its `.hatch`, either way —
    the header's `Target` first, then `generate.out` and `upstream` — with `exists` and
    `how`, or `reason` when there is none: `no-out`, `outside-upstream`, `flat-out`,
    `outside-out`, `not-a-patch-name`, `two-patches`, `unsafe-target` (a `Target` that
    leaves its root), `newer-format` (update hatch), `older-format` (regenerate the
    patch), `bad-header` (a header that does not read).
  - A line that is JSON but not a request object (`null`, `42`, `[…]`) is answered with
    `BadRequest` and `id` 0, and the service goes on; before, it ended the process. A
    param of the wrong type — `path: 42`, `limits: "all"` — is a `BadRequest` that names
    it, not whatever the code it reached threw (`TypeError`). Values a config checks
    (`exact`, `bridgeGap`, `out`, the keys of `limits`) answer `ConfigError`, as before.
  - `SynthesisError` with `detail.reason: "no-match"` also when no candidate pattern
    could be built around the change (it said `ambiguous`, and nothing had fitted twice).
  - `generate` answers `warningsAt` beside `warnings`: `{ hunk, mdLine, message }`.
  - `cancel { id }` takes back a request still running: `generate` stops before its next
    change and answers the new error kind `Cancelled`; `{ cancelled: false }` when no
    such request runs. Killing the process still works as it did.
  - `config` for a file whose git base cannot be read — not committed yet, no such
    branch — answers the settings with `base: { kind: "unavailable", error }` instead
    of failing with `GitError`, and watches `HEAD` and the branch, so that the next
    commit changes the answer (before the first commit, too).
  - `resolve` answers `baseText` when the base came out of git.
  - `resolve`/`apply` with a `path` and no base take the config's `generate.base`, as
    `generate` does (refused before).

- Config schema 2 (`CONFIG_MIN` 2 — see Breaking): `generate.base.head`,
  `generate.base.branch`, `generate.base.commit`, `generate.base.eol` — the old version
  `generate` compares against, named once for the project as `--head` / `--branch` /
  `--commit` name it — and `upstream`. With a base set, `hatch generate --in <file>`
  needs no source flag. Any git flag replaces all three for that run; `--in-old`
  ignores them. Over the service, a `generate` that sends neither `baseText` nor
  `baseGit` takes this base (protocol 4: such a request was refused before). hatch 0.3.0
  meeting `"version": 2` says to update hatch.

- `hatch init` writes a `hatch.config.json`: only `"$schema"` and `"version"`, so every
  default stays the built-in one. `--config-version <n>` picks the schema (a line on
  stderr when it is not the newest), `--dir` the directory (default: the git root around
  the current directory, outside a repository the directory itself), `--force` replaces
  an existing file (without it: exit 5, the file untouched), `--dry-run` prints instead.
- Protocol 4: the method `configTemplate` answers the
  text of a new config for a schema version and initial settings, the path the core
  would look for it at, whether a file is there, and every schema version in the range
  with a one-line summary. It writes nothing. A `ConfigError` about keys outside the
  chosen schema carries `detail.version` and `detail.keys`; a key a schema dropped is
  named with the schemas that had it (`generate.mirror`: `since: 1`, `until: 1`) and what
  took its place.
- Each config schema has its own JSON Schema, `schemas/hatch.config.v<N>.schema.json`,
  and a written config points its `"$schema"` at the one of its version — read from the
  tag of the release that shipped it, so a released schema never changes (until then,
  from `main`).
  `hatch.config.schema.json` stays the newest schema, for SchemaStore.

### Changed

- Two git refusals of the CLI read differently: a path out of the repository is
  `--in /abs/x.cc: outside its repository root …` (was `--in: /abs/x.cc is outside …`),
  and the advice after "not a branch" / "not on branch" names the coordinate before its
  flag — `name any other revision as the commit (--commit)`.
- The generate goldens record the header `generate` writes (`Hatch`, `Target`,
  `Grammar`), the apply goldens open with `Hatch` and `Target`; one of them (`c/apply/9`)
  stays without a header, as a hand-written patch. The hunks are the same to the byte.

- A config is checked against the keys of the schema its `"version"` names: a key of
  a newer schema is refused with the schema it belongs to.
- `generate` checks the place for the patch before synthesis, in the CLI and over the
  service: an `--out` under a file fails at once, not after the work — and before
  `NoChanges`.
- `hatch apply` that would write a file with the very text it holds writes nothing, and
  says `already so: not written`: the file keeps its mtime.
- `hatch apply` refusing to write a git version over a file with changes of its own says
  `the result would go over <file>, which holds changes …` — it named `--out` and `--in`
  even when neither was typed. The exit code is 1, as before.
- `generate -a`, and `generate` handing a change to the editor, lay each kept hunk once
  instead of replaying every hunk on every step: 100 changes in a 1000-line file take
  about 3 s instead of about 3 minutes; the hunks are the same.
- `config` over a git base asks git 5 times instead of 8: about 40% faster.
- `hatch init --dry-run` says `printed config schema vN`, not `wrote`.

### Fixed

- A file whose name starts with two dots (`..hidden.c`) was taken for a path out of its
  root: refused as `--repo-path` or as the file of a git base, and left without a
  `Target` or a `pair`. It is inside, as any other name.
- The config search from the home directory itself went on above it (`/Users`); it
  stops there, as it always did from below it.
- A patch whose headings spell its language in two cases (`# match cpp`, `# match CPP`)
  was refused as two languages; it is one.
- `hatch apply --config` was described and refused as an unknown argument; it works, as
  it does for `hatch-apply`.
- `hatch-apply apply` with `--in` relative to a directory below the repository root
  wrote the result to that path from the root — another file — and exited 0; it writes
  the file named.
- `apply --eol` was ignored without a git source and never checked; it is checked now,
  and refused when no version out of git is named. The flag has not shipped yet (F2).
- On Windows, a run writing `--out` over a file another run held open failed with
  `EPERM` instead of writing it: the rename is tried again for up to two seconds, so
  each run lands whole and one of them wins — what the write promised everywhere else.
- The service cut a request in two at U+2028 or U+2029 inside a string — characters
  `JSON.stringify` leaves as they are — and answered two `BadRequest`s with `id: 0`, never
  the request itself (a `generate` waited for ever). A line now ends at `\n` alone, as the
  transport always said (protocol 4, unreleased).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-09-28

**Protocol 2–3 · config schema 1–1**

### Added

- **Writing a hunk by hand.** When synthesis cannot anchor a change and a person is at
  the terminal, `generate` offers the editor (`$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` / `vi`, `notepad`)
  with every hunk so far and a hunk to start from; the result is checked — it must parse
  and land on the old version — and asked about again until it does, or the run stops
  without a `.md`. Synthesis then goes on from what those hunks produce. Without a
  terminal the error is the same as before.

- `apply` reads the file to patch out of git with the same flags and the same rules as
  `generate` — `--head`, `--branch`, `--commit`, `--repo-path`. With a git coordinate
  `--in` only names the file: the repository, the default path in it, the name of the
  result; it need not exist on disk. `--verify --branch main` answers "does this patch
  still fit main" without checking anything out.
- A request git can carry out but that may not mean what it says is **asked about**
  instead of refused: a `--commit` not on the `--branch` named beside it, a tag or a
  raw sha given as `--branch`, and `apply` writing a git version over an `--in` that
  holds changes that version lacks. The default answer is no; `--yes` / `-y` answers
  yes in advance; with no terminal to answer the answer is no. What git cannot carry
  out at all is still refused, `--yes` or not.
- Service, protocol 3 (additive, `protocolMin` stays 2): `resolve` and `apply` take
  `baseGit` like `generate` does and answer `baseSpec`; `version` announces
  `protocolMin` and `configSchemaMin`.
- The config schema version is a range: a `"version"` newer than this hatch reads says
  "update hatch", an older one says "move the file", instead of one message for both.
- `hatch.config.json` is ready for the SchemaStore catalog (`.github/schemastore/`):
  once listed, VS Code and JetBrains check and complete it by the file name.
- `PROTOCOL.md`: the service contract — transport, methods, errors, the link table, how
  a client checks the version — in the repository and in the package.

### Breaking

- `generate -a`: `n` no longer leaves a hunk out. It offers to write the hunks by hand
  in the editor; refusing that — or having no terminal — stops the run without a `.md`.
  Hunks are asked about as they are made, not after all of them. Leaving a hunk out
  after the fact used to break the ones built on top of it (4 of 36 cases in the golden
  set) and wrote the broken `.md` silently. Shipped without the minor release F2 asks
  for, by the author's decision.
  → to keep a change out of the `.md`, take it out of the new version (`--in`) before
  generating, or answer `n` and edit that hunk away in the editor; a script that piped
  `n` to drop hunks now stops with exit 1.

### Changed
- `generate -a` stops when its input closes before every hunk is answered — piped
  answers running out, `< /dev/null`, CI — and writes nothing, saying at which hunk it
  stopped. It used to fail with "readline was closed". Answers may still be piped in,
  one line per hunk.
- An empty language — `--language ""`, `params.language: ""` — is the same as none in
  every command and service method, and the language comes from the heading or the
  extension. `apply` and the service's `generate` used to refuse it, `resolve` did not.

- `generate` writes the language's own name into `# match` — `cpp`, `objc`, `python` —
  in the CLI and in the service alike, however the language was picked. The CLI used to
  write the file's extension (`# match cc`) and the service the name, so one file gave
  two different `.md`. A visible change of the printed form only: every `.md` already
  written applies as before.

### Fixed

- A `.md` written by `generate` 0.2.0 or earlier for a `.m`, `.mm`, `.pyi`, `.kts`,
  `.mts`, `.cts` or `.inc` file applies: it names the language by the extension
  (`# match mm`), and `apply` did not know those extensions as names. Every extension a
  language claims is now also its name, and `generate` refuses to write a heading
  `apply` would read back as another language. The service's `version` lists the new
  names in `languages`.
- `--branch` names a branch even when a tag has the same name (`v1.2` the release
  branch beside `v1.2` the tag): git calls the short name ambiguous, and hatch used to
  answer "not a branch" — or, told `--yes`, read the tag. The service's `baseGit` too.
- `apply` asks before writing over `--in` when `--out` is the same file spelled another
  way — `F.cc` for `f.cc` on a case-insensitive disk.
- `--branch` / `--commit` values that start with `-` are refused before git sees them:
  `--branch --all` made git list every ref and hatch answer about a missing file.
- `hatch constructor`, `hatch toString` and the like are unknown commands; `hatch help
  constructor` no longer crashes with a stack trace.
- `hatch grammars` no longer reads every grammar in full just to see that it is there,
  and reports a cache entry that failed its checksum and was fetched again as
  `downloaded`, not `cache`.
- Writing a file keeps its permission bits (a script stays executable) and writes
  through a symlink to the file it points to, leaving the link a link — both used to be
  lost to the rename.
- `hatch.config.schema.json` has an `$id` that resolves, and its `version` description
  no longer spells out numbers that go stale.
- A patch applied to a CRLF file writes CRLF lines. A `.md` carries no line endings of
  its own — the parser reads `\r\n` and `\n` alike, and git or an editor may turn them
  either way — so a patch of several lines used to land with LF in the middle of a CRLF
  file, and `generate` → `apply` did not give the new file back. Now a bare LF of the
  patch takes the ending of the line the edit starts on. **An `apply` result changes**
  for multi-line patches on CRLF files only; the old result (mixed line endings) was
  the bug. LF files apply byte for byte as before. The same holds for the service's
  `resolve` and `apply`.
- The extension of a file is read from its name only: a dot in a directory
  (`my.proj/Makefile`) is no longer taken for one.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-24

**Protocol 2–2 · config schema 1–1**

### Breaking

- `--branch` takes a branch only; a tag or a raw sha is refused with a pointer to
  `--commit`.
  → pass a tag or a sha as `--commit v1.2`, not `--branch v1.2`.
- A value that is itself another option of the same command is refused
  (`--out --exact` used to write into a directory named `--exact`).
  → give every option that takes a value its value; a file literally named like an
  option goes as `./--exact`.
- `hatch.config.json` is looked for up to the repository root and never above the home
  directory: a config above the repository no longer applies.
  → move the file into the repository root (or pass it with `--config <path>`).
- `apply --out` follows the same placement rules as `generate --out`.
  → a relative `--out` now counts from the repository root and a directory gets the
  name of `--in` inside it; pass an absolute path to write exactly where you mean.

### Added

- The service: a long-running process speaking JSON over stdio — `version`, `generate`,
  `resolve`, `apply`, progress as separate messages. Hunk coordinates in both the base
  and the patched text. Protocol 1 was never released; this is protocol 2.
- Public API: `generatePatch` (the whole of `generate` on text) and `resolveHunks`.
- The old version out of git by three independent coordinates — `--head`, `--branch`,
  `--commit`, `--repo-path` — each one optional, each defaulted: the branch we are on,
  its last commit, the path of `--in`. `--branch` with `--commit` checks the commit is
  on the branch. The service takes the same as `baseGit`.
- One set of rules for `--out` in both commands: a directory or a file, missing
  directories created, a relative path from the repository root, `-` for stdout.
  `--mirror` / `generate.mirror` keeps patches in a tree of their own (the config key
  was added without raising the schema number — see VERSIONING.md).
- A misspelt option is met with the nearest one ("did you mean --branch?").
- `--log` overwrites its file instead of failing on it; a log that cannot be opened is
  a warning, the run goes on.

### Fixed

- Faster synthesis: the source map is built once per text, occurrences are counted
  lazily.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-27

**No service · config schema 1–1**

### Fixed

- The installed `hatch` command runs again: the `#!/usr/bin/env node` line is back.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-27

**No service · config schema 1–1**

First release.

- `hatch apply` — applies `.md` match/patch instructions to a source file, hunk by hunk.
- `hatch generate` — writes those instructions from two versions of a file, anchored
  structurally (enclosing blocks, not neighbouring lines), each hunk checked by applying
  it.
- `hatch grammars` — puts the tree-sitter grammars in place; the only command that goes
  online.
- Languages: C, C++, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, TypeScript, TSX, Rust, Go,
  Python.
- `hatch.config.json` for the anchoring policy, with `--print-config` showing where
  every value came from.
- A public API (`applyAll`, `synthesize`, `parseHatchFile`, `printHatchFile`, the
  language adapters), `npm pack`, CI and the tag-driven release.
